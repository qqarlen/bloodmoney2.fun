📅 Release Date: September 12, 2025
👤 Developer: ShroomyChrist Studios
🕹️ Platform: Play online or download from itch.io

🔎 Overview
Blood Money 2, also known as Human Expenditure Program, is a psychological horror simulation that blends suspense, drama, and ethical dilemmas into a dark yet deceptively cute interactive experience. Players step into the shoes of Harvey Harvington’s caretaker, navigating a twisted virtual world where every decision tests morality, responsibility, and empathy. What begins as simple care quickly evolves into a disturbing moral experiment—your choices have real consequences.

🎮 Gameplay
At its core, Blood Money 2 combines simulation mechanics with narrative-driven choices:

🍼 Interactive Care: Feed, rest, and play with Harvey as if he were a real pet, but with human consequences.
🎯 Minigames & Events: Engage in interactive challenges that influence Harvey’s wellbeing and the story.
🧠 Memory System: Harvey remembers your actions. Neglect or mistreatment shapes his reactions in future interactions.
⚖️ Moral & Ethical Dilemmas: Decide how far you’re willing to go, balancing personal gain against Harvey’s welfare.
🌿 Branching Endings: Multiple outcomes reflect your choices, from empathy-driven “good” endings to harsh consequences.
Unlike typical pet simulators or idle clickers, Blood Money 2’s power comes from its subtle psychological horror. There are no monsters or jump scares—the unease comes from the recognition of responsibility, complicity, and human exploitation.

🌆 Story & Setting
Set in a confined, near-future dystopia, the game places Harvey at the center of a mysterious program—sometimes referred to as the Human Expenditure Program. Is it a corporate project, a scientific trial, or a societal metaphor? The ambiguity forces players to focus on the ethical weight of their choices rather than external lore.

As Harvey’s caretaker, you interact directly with him through dialogue, actions, and moral decisions. Your treatment affects not only his immediate wellbeing but also the narrative trajectory and eventual ending.
